<b>Step 1: Animating a platform and a ball</b>  
The first step will teach you how you use a sprite as a platform to juggle the ball
    
   <b>Activity Checklist</b>
   - [ ]  Start a new Scratch and delete the cat sprite so that your project is empty.  
   
   - [ ]  Change the background of the stage to black. You can do this in the backdrops tab of the stage. Then, add a Platform, a ball and the lava floor. (The Platform is just a D letter). This is what the stage should look like:

   - [ ] Next, we have to set the costume center. Click on the ball sprite and select the costumes tab. Click on the cross in the top right corner of the costumes screen. A cross will appear.

   - [ ] Put the center of the cross right in the middle of the ball and then do the same with the D letter, but here, put the cross in the bottom right corner of the letter.
   
   - [ ] Add the following code to your D sprite:

   - [ ] In order to completely write this code, a new variable has to be made. Click on Make a Variable under the Data option and call it "Degrees".

   - [ ] If you now click on the green flag above the project, the D should turn sideways and glide a little bit torwards the bottom of the screen and turn into a platform!

<b>Step 1: Animating a platform </b>
The first step will teach you how you use a sprite as a platform to juggle the ball
    
   <b>Activity Checklist</b>
   - [ ]  Start a new Scratch and delete the cat sprite so that your project is empty.  
   - [ ]  Change the background of the stage to black. You can do this in the backdrops tab of the stage. Then, add a Platform, a ball and the lava floor. (The Platform is just a D letter)
